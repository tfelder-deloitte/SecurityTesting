# Downloading and running

## Positioning ${solution_name} in the build process

### Build mode

In [build mode](../components/detectors/#build-detectors-versus-buildless-detectors), which is the default,
${solution_name} should be executed as a post-build step in the build environment of the project.
Building your project prior to running ${solution_name} is often required for the detector to run successfully,
and helps ensure that the build artifacts are available for signature scanning.

### Buildless mode

In [buildless mode](../components/detectors/#build-detectors-versus-buildless-detectors),
${solution_name} makes its best effort to discover dependencies without the benefit of
build artifacts or build tools. In buildless mode, there is no requirement that ${solution_name} must run as a post-build step.
Results from buildless mode may be less accurate than results from build mode.

## Choosing the working directory

You can run ${solution_name} from any directory. If you are not running ${solution_name} from the project directory,
provide the project directory using the [source path property](../properties/configuration/paths/#source-path). When that property is not set,
${solution_name} assumes the current working directory is the project directory.

## Choosing a run method (script or .jar)

There are two ways to run ${solution_name}:

1. Download and run a ${solution_name} script.
1. Download and run a ${solution_name} .jar file.

The primary reason to run a ${solution_name} script is that the scripts by default always
run the latest version of the ${solution_name} .jar file; downloading it for you if necessary.
When run this way, ${solution_name} automatically updates itself; as soon as a new version becomes
available, the new version automatically runs, unless you override this default behavior.

The primary reason to run the ${solution_name} .jar directly is that this method provides
direct control over the ${solution_name} version;
${solution_name} does not automatically update in this scenario.

## Running the ${solution_name} script

The primary function of the ${solution_name} scripts is to download and execute the ${solution_name} .jar file.
Several aspects of script functionality can be configured, including:

* The ${solution_name} version to download/run; by default, the latest version.
* The download location.
* Where to find Java.

Information on how to configure the scripts is in [Shell script configuration](../advanced/script-configuration/).

#### Linux or Mac (Bash)

To download and run the latest version of ${solution_name} in a single command:

    bash <(curl -s -L https://detect.synopsys.com/detect.sh)

Append any command line arguments to the end, separated by spaces. For example:

    bash <(curl -s -L https://detect.synopsys.com/detect.sh) --blackduck.url=https://blackduck.mydomain.com --blackduck.username=myusername

#### Windows (PowerShell)

To download and run the latest version of ${solution_name} in a single command:

    powershell "[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 'tls12'; irm https://detect.synopsys.com/detect.ps1?$(Get-Random) | iex; detect"

Append any command line arguments to the end, separated by spaces. For example:

    powershell "[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 'tls12'; irm https://detect.synopsys.com/detect.ps1?$(Get-Random) | iex; detect" --blackduck.url=https://blackduck.mydomain.com --blackduck.username=myusername

### Running a specific version of ${solution_name}

#### Linux or Mac (Bash)

To run a specific version of ${solution_name}:

    export DETECT_LATEST_RELEASE_VERSION={${solution_name} version}
    bash <(curl -s -L https://detect.synopsys.com/detect.sh)

For example, to run ${solution_name} version 5.5.0:

    export DETECT_LATEST_RELEASE_VERSION=5.5.0
    bash <(curl -s -L https://detect.synopsys.com/detect.sh)

#### Windows (PowerShell)

To run a specific version of ${solution_name}:

    $Env:DETECT_LATEST_RELEASE_VERSION = {${solution_name} version}
    powershell "[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 'tls12'; irm https://detect.synopsys.com/detect.ps1?$(Get-Random) | iex; detect"

For example, to run ${solution_name} version 5.5.0:

    $Env:DETECT_LATEST_RELEASE_VERSION = 5.5.0
    powershell "[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = 'tls12'; irm https://detect.synopsys.com/detect.ps1?$(Get-Random) | iex; detect"

## Running the ${solution_name} .jar

Recent versions of the ${solution_name} .jar file are available for download from ${binary_repo_url_base}/${binary_repo_repo}/com/synopsys/integration/${project_name}.

To run ${solution_name} by invoking the .jar file:

    java -jar {path to .jar file}

For example:

    curl -O ${binary_repo_url_base}/${binary_repo_repo}/com/synopsys/integration/${project_name}/5.6.2/synopsys-detect-5.6.2.jar
    java -jar synopsys-detect-5.6.2.jar

You can use the ${solution_name} Bash script (${bash_script_name}) to download the ${solution_name} .jar file:

    export DETECT_DOWNLOAD_ONLY=1
    ./${bash_script_name}

## Including and excluding tools and detectors

[Properties](../properties/all-properties/) provide a variety of options for configuring ${solution_name} behavior. One of the
most fundamental ways to modify ${solution_name} is by including and excluding [tools](../components/tools/) and [detectors](../components/detectors/).

### Tools

By default, all tools are eligible to run; the set of tools that actually run
depends on the properties you set.
To limit the eligible tools to a given list, use:

    --detect.tools={comma-separated list of tool names, all uppercase}

To exclude specific tools, use:

    --detect.tools.excluded={comma-separated list of tool names, all uppercase}

Exclusions take precedence over inclusions.

Refer to [Tools](../components/tools/) for the list of tool names.

Refer to [Properties](../properties/all-properties/) for details.

### Detectors

By default, all detectors are eligible to run.  The set of detectors that actually
run depends on the files existing in your project directory.
To limit the eligible detectors to a given list, use:

    --detect.included.detector.types={comma-separated list of detector names}

To exclude specific detectors, use:

    --detect.excluded.detector.types={comma-separated list of detector names}

Exclusions take precedence over inclusions.

Refer to [Detectors](../components/detectors/) for the list of detector names.

Refer to [Properties](../properties/all-properties/) for details.

## Running with ${blackduck_product_name}

${solution_name} can be used with ${blackduck_product_name} to perform Software Composition Analysis (SCA).

### Overview

When ${blackduck_product_name} connection details are provided, ${solution_name} executes
the following by default:

* The [detector tool](../components/detectors/), which runs the appropriate package manager-specific detector; the Maven detector
for Maven projects, the Gradle detector for Gradle projects, and so forth.
* The [${blackduck_signature_scanner_name}](../properties/configuration/signature scanner/), which performs a ${blackduck_signature_scan_act} on the
project directory.

${solution_name} can be configured to perform additional tasks, including the following:

* Enable any of the supported snippet matching modes in the [${blackduck_signature_scanner_name}](../properties/configuration/signature scanner/).
* Run [${blackduck_binary_scan_capability}](../properties/configuration/signature scanner/#binary-scan-target) on a given binary files.
* Run the ${dockerinspector_name} on a given [Docker image](../advanced/package-managers/docker-images/).
* Generate a [report](../properties/configuration/report/).
* Fail on [policy violation](../properties/configuration/project/#fail-on-policy-violation-severities-advanced).

Refer to [${blackduck_product_name} Server properties](../properties/configuration/blackduck server/)
and [${blackduck_signature_scanner_name} properties](../properties/configuration/signature scanner/) for details.

### Offline mode

If you do not have a ${blackduck_product_name} instance, or if your network is down, you can still run ${solution_name} in offline mode.
In offline mode, ${solution_name} creates the BDIO content and the dry run ${blackduck_signature_scan_act} output files without attempting to upload them to ${blackduck_product_name}.
You can run ${solution_name} in offline mode using the [offline mode property](../properties/configuration/blackduck server/#offline-mode).

### BDIO format

${solution_name} produces dependency information for Black Duck in Black Duck Input Output (BDIO) format files.
${solution_name} can produce BDIO files in two formats: BDIO version 1, or BDIO version 2.
Versions of Black Duck prior to 2018.12.4 accept only BDIO 1. Black Duck versions 2018.12.4 and higher
accept either BDIO 1 or BDIO 2.
By default, ${solution_name} produces BDIO 1 files.

Use the [BDIO2 enabled property](../properties/configuration/paths/#bdio-2-enabled) to select BDIO 2 format.

## Running with ${polaris_product_name}

This capability is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

${solution_name} can be used with ${polaris_product_name} to perform Static Application Security Testing (SAST).

When ${polaris_product_name} connection details are provided, ${solution_name} executes
the following by default:

* The detector tool, which runs the appropriate package manager-specific detector; the Maven detector
for Maven projects, the Gradle detector for Gradle projects, and so forth.
* The ${polaris_product_name} tool, which runs the ${polaris_product_name} CLI on the
project directory.

Refer to [Properties](../properties/configuration/polaris/) for details.
