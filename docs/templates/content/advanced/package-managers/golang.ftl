${solution_name} has four detectors for GoLang:

* [Go Lock (GO_DEP) detector](#godeplockdetector)
* [Go Gradle (GO_GRADLE) detector](#godepclidetector)

## Go Lock (GO_DEP) detector

The Go Lock (GO_DEP) detector:

* discovers dependencies of GoLang projects.
* attempts to run on your project if a Gopkg.lock file is found in your source directory.
* does not rely on external executables; for example, go, dep, and others.
* parses Gopkg.lock for dependencies.

## The Go Gradle (GO_GRADLE) detector

The Go Gradle (GO_GRADLE) detector:

* discovers dependencies of go language (GoLang) projects.
* attempts to run on your project if a gogradle.lock file is found in your source directory.
* does not rely on external executables; for example, go, dep, and others.
* parses gogradle.lock for dependencies.

<a name="gomodclidetector"></a>
## The Go Mod Cli (GO_MOD) detector

The Go Mod Cli (GO_MOD) detector:

* discovers dependencies of go language (GoLang) projects.
* attempts to run on your project if a go.mod file is found in your source directory.
* requires that the *go* executable is on the PATH.
* runs *go list -m* and *go mod graph*, and parses the output of both to discover dependencies.

## The Go Vendor (GO_VENDOR) detector

The Go Vendor (GO_VENDOR) detector:

* discovers dependencies of go language (GoLang) projects.
* attempts to run on your project if the file vendor/vendor.json is found in your source directory.
* does not rely on external executables; for example, go, dep, and others.
* parses vendor/vendor.json for dependencies.

<a name="govndrdetector"></a>
## The Go Vndr (GO_VNDR) detector

The Go Vndr (GO_VNDR) detector:

* discovers dependencies of go language (GoLang) projects.
* attempts to run on your project if the file vendor.conf is found in your source directory.
* does not rely on external executables; for example, go, dep, and others.
* parses vendor.conf for dependencies.
