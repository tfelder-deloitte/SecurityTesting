# Introduction

${solution_name} analyzes your software project to identify open source component dependencies.
${solution_name} uploads the identities of those components to ${blackduck_product_name}.
${blackduck_product_name} utilizes this information to build an open source software Bill Of Materials (BOM) for your project,
and identify any associated security vulnerabilities and software licenses.

${solution_name} discovers components using a variety of detection methods, including:

* Package manager inspection utilizing commonly used tools such as Maven, Gradle, etc.
* File scanning utilizing the ${blackduck_signature_scanner_name}.
* Docker image inspection utilizing the ${dockerinspector_name}.
* Binary file analysis utilizing ${blackduck_binary_scan_capability}.

By combining all these techniques ${solution_name} is capable of scanning a wide range of software projects
utilizing a variety of package managers and programming languages for open source components that are registered within the ${blackduck_kb}.

${solution_name} runs on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. It is available through GitHub, under a permissive
Apache license and does not require pre-installation or configuration.
For more information, refer to [Requirements](../10-requirements/).

Although ${solution_name} can support large projects, care should be taken to ensure that scans are performed to optimize platform performance and produce manageable and meaningful results.
For applications containing multiple sub-projects, it may be advantageous to scan sub-projects separately and combine results as a project of projects, or other techniques.

## A typical ${solution_name} run

While there are many variations on a ${solution_name} run, a typical ${solution_name} run performs the steps described
as follows. In this example, the user has provided ${blackduck_product_name} connection details through property settings
to ${solution_name}, signalling that results (project dependency details)
are to be uploaded to ${blackduck_product_name}.

In a typical run, ${solution_name}:

1. Uses the project's package manager to derive the hierarchy of dependencies known to that package manager.
For example, on a Maven project, ${solution_name} executes an "mvn dependency:tree" command,
and derives dependency information from the output.
2. Runs the ${blackduck_signature_scanner_name} on the project. This may identify additional dependencies
not known to the package manager (for example, a .jar file copied into the project directory).
3. Uploads both sets of results (dependency details) to ${blackduck_product_name} creating the project/version
if it does not already exist. ${blackduck_product_name} uses the uploaded dependency information
to build the Bill Of Materials (BOM) for the project/version.

## ${solution_name} processing in more detail

${solution_name} processing is divided into three phases:

* Initialization
* Run
* Cleanup

### Initialization phase

During the initialization phase, ${solution_name} performs verification checks on the user-provided configration, checks to see if it
can connect to any external systems needed for the run, and creates any required directories.

### Run phase

During the run phase, ${solution_name} processes an ordered list of [tools](../components/tools/), invoking all that apply.
Tool applicability depends on how ${solution_name} is configured; in other words, the property values you set.
The detector tool runs by default. The ${blackduck_signature_scanner_name} tool runs by default when ${blackduck_product_name} connection
details are provided.

The detector tool invokes all applicable [detectors](../components/detectors/).
Detector applicability depends on what ${solution_name} finds in your project. For example, if ${solution_name}
finds a pom.xml file, it runs the Maven detector. If it finds Gradle files, it runs the Gradle detector.

In the typical run previously described, two tools are applied: the detector tool which ran the Maven detector,
and the ${blackduck_signature_scanner_name} tool which ran the ${blackduck_signature_scanner_name}.

At the end of the run phase, ${solution_name} uploads results to the appropriate external
system(s) (${blackduck_product_name} and/or ${polaris_product_name}), and optionally perform post actions, such as generating
a risk report or checking for policy violations.

In the typical run previously described, ${solution_name} uploads ${blackduck_product_name} results from
the Maven detector and the ${blackduck_signature_scanner_name}.

### Cleanup phase

During the cleanup phase, ${solution_name} removes temporary files and directories before exiting.
